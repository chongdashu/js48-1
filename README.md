# JS48 Episode 1

## About
[JS 48](https://itch.io/jam/js48-1) is a game jam where developers need to make the best Html5 games they can within 48 hours. The goal of this jam is to show what is possible in Html5. The first edition of this will take place from 9-11 October 2015.

### Rules

1.  The executed code needs to run in a common browser (chrome, firefox, safari, ie) with no plugins.

2. The game needs to be submitted by 8pm on Sunday night. No late entries will be accepted.

3. You are encouraged to use an engine from the list, but you don't have to!

4. You cannot submit a game that was already completed before the competition began. Create something new within the time!

Currently, this is a just simple skeleton project that contains the
directory layout and some commonly used files and 
libraries for quick game and application development
with [Phaser](http://phaser.io).
